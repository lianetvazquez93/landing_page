                        <div class="dessert">Arroz con leche</div>
                        <p>It is a dessert that is made by cooking the rice with
                         milk, sugar and a cinnamon stick until it is very soft 
                         and creamy. It is consumed cold and in one of its Creole 
                         versions it can be prepared adding to it fresh shredded 
                         coconut.</p>

                        <p>To a can of condensed milk add a cup of evaporated milk,
                         5 eggs and a teaspoon of vanilla, beat well and the mixture 
                         is deposited in a container whose interior has been previously
                         covered with a caramel. Cover with baking paper and cook in 
                         a bain-marie for 1 hour (30 minutes if under pressure).Allow 
                         to cool at least 2 hours before unmolding.</p>

                        <div class="dessert">Dulce de leche cortada</div>
                        <p>If the milk was cut, do not throw it away! Add a good amount
                         of sugar and let the mixture boil until it thickens. If you 
                         add a piece of lemon or orange rind, the result will be even 
                         better. An exquisite sweet that you will surely have to 
                         repeat.</p>
